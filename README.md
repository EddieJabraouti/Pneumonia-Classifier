**Pneumonia Classifier:**
This project is a web application that classifies chest X-ray images as either Pneumonia or Normal using a deep-learning model. The repository is organized into a Python backend for model inference and an API, a JavaScript frontend for the user interface, a model area for training assets, and an xray folder with sample images. The repository language breakdown indicates primarily JavaScript and Python, and a Dockerfile is included for containerization. 

**What’s included:**
The backend directory contains the server-side code that loads the model and exposes endpoints for inference. The frontend directory contains the client-side code that provides the user experience for uploading images and viewing predictions. The model directory is intended for training scripts, notebooks, and model weights. The xray directory includes example chest X-ray images suitable for quick local checks. The presence of these top-level folders is visible on the repository’s main page

**Running the project:**
You can run this project either in a container or directly on your machine. If you choose a containerized workflow, build the image from the Dockerfile at the repository root and then start a container from that image. When the server starts, read the terminal or container logs to determine the exact address and port it is listening on; use that printed address to access the running service. If you prefer local development, set up the backend by creating an isolated Python environment, install the dependencies specified by the backend, and start the application using the entry point defined in the backend code. Set up the frontend by installing its JavaScript dependencies and running the development server defined by its package script. In both cases, rely on the process output to learn the active host, port, and any auto-generated links rather than assuming specific values.

**API overview:**
The backend exposes an HTTP interface for image classification. The typical pattern is to send an image file to an inference endpoint and receive a JSON response containing a predicted label and a confidence score. Consult the backend source to confirm the exact path of the inference route, the HTTP method, the expected form or JSON field names, and any authentication or CORS behavior. Avoid assuming endpoint names such as “/predict” or documentation routes; instead, verify them directly in the code or in runtime logs.

**Frontend usage:**
Once the frontend is running, open the address shown by the frontend’s startup output. Use the UI to select an X-ray image and submit it to the backend. The page will display the model’s prediction and any associated confidence or error messages. If the frontend is designed to be served by the backend in production, follow the project’s build instructions and ensure the backend is configured to serve the built assets; otherwise, run the two services separately and configure the frontend to point to the backend’s actual URL.
Training and fine-tuning
Use the model directory for training and experimentation. The usual workflow is to obtain a suitable chest X-ray dataset, run the provided training or fine-tuning script or notebook, and produce a weights file compatible with the backend’s loader. After training, place the resulting weights where the backend expects them and update any configuration variables so inference uses your newly trained model.

**Configuration:** 
Common configuration items include a path to the model weights, the compute device selection (for example, CPU or a supported GPU), file-type allowlists for uploads, and any classification thresholds that control decision behavior. Store these settings in environment variables or configuration files as the backend expects. Always consult the backend code to confirm variable names and defaults rather than inferring them.

**Typical workflow:**
Decide whether to run with containers or locally. Start the backend and note the exact address that the server prints when it becomes ready. Start the frontend and note its printed address. If the two services run separately, configure the frontend to call the backend using the real backend address. Upload a test image from the xray folder and confirm you receive a prediction and a confidence value. If anything fails, read the server logs to identify missing files, misconfigured paths, or cross-origin issues and adjust configuration accordingly. The xray folder’s presence is visible on the repository page and is useful for quick checks.
