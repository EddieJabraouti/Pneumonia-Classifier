Pneumonia Classifier
This project is a web application that classifies chest X-ray images as either Pneumonia or Normal using a deep learning model. It is organized with a Python backend that provides an API for inference, a JavaScript frontend for the user interface, and a Dockerfile for containerized deployment. A small collection of X-ray images is also included for quick testing.

Features
The application allows users to upload a chest X-ray image and immediately receive a classification result with a confidence score. A REST API is provided so predictions can also be requested programmatically. The repository includes training and fine-tuning code in the model folder and is designed to run both locally and inside a Docker container.

Quick Start
To run the application using Docker, you first build the Docker image with the command “docker build -t pneumonia-classifier .” and then start the container with “docker run -p 8000:8000 pneumonia-classifier”. Once the container is running, the backend API documentation is available at http://localhost:8000/docs, and if the frontend runs separately, it can be opened at http://localhost:5173.
For local development without Docker, start with the backend. Navigate into the backend folder, create a virtual environment, activate it, and install the dependencies listed in requirements.txt. Once that is complete, you can launch the API server with Uvicorn, which by default will serve the application at http://localhost:8000. For the frontend, navigate into the frontend folder, install the Node dependencies with npm install, and then run the development server with npm run dev. The frontend will usually be available at http://localhost:5173.

API Usage
To classify an image through the API, send a POST request to the /predict endpoint with a chest X-ray file attached as form data. The server will respond with a JSON object containing the predicted label (for example, PNEUMONIA or NORMAL) and a confidence value between 0 and 1.

Repository Structure
The backend folder contains the Python API and inference code. The frontend folder holds the JavaScript user interface. The model folder is where you will find training scripts, notebooks, and saved weights. The xray folder provides example chest X-ray images for testing. At the top level, a Dockerfile is included for container builds.

Training or Fine-Tuning
Inside the model folder you may find scripts or notebooks for training the classifier. The general workflow is to first download a chest X-ray dataset, then run the training script with your dataset and training parameters, which will generate a new weights file. Once training is complete, place the resulting weights file in the model folder and update the backend configuration to point to it so that the application uses your trained model.

Configuration
Several configuration values are commonly adjusted. These include the model path that points to the trained weights file, the device which can be set to either CPU or CUDA, the threshold that controls the decision boundary for classification, and the list of allowed file types such as jpg or png. These can be stored in a configuration file or set as environment variables.

Example Workflow
The typical workflow is to build and run the app either with Docker or through local development, then open the frontend in a browser. You can upload a chest X-ray image through the interface and receive the classification result with a confidence score. Alternatively, you can send requests directly to the backend API using tools such as curl or Postman.
